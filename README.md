<h1>Introduction</h1>


<p1>The problem we have solved involves creating a self-driving car capable of completing laps within the boundaries of the track, overcoming colored obstacles based on their color, and finally parking in a designated area within the track. To achieve this, we used electronic components with functional capabilities that serve the solution, as well as mechanical techniques that aid in movement.

Regarding the codes, we used a Python code to capture images using a camera and process them to identify the locations and colors of the obstacles, and then send the information to the Arduino board. The Arduino board uses this information along with sensor readings, which are processed using Arduino C code, to control the motors' movements to correctly navigate the obstacles and complete the laps within the track.
This repository will explain the following:

 </ol>



 <h3>2- Configuring Remote Access for Raspberry Pi</h3>

<p>There are many ways to control your Raspberry Pi, but you will need to access a Raspberry Pi without connecting it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. we will need to manage it remotely to facilitate working on the car, and therefore we will need the following:</p>
<p>To manage your Raspberry Pi from a different device within your local network, consider utilizing <b>SSH</b>.<br> SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol designed to establish a secure connection for remote access and management of systems such as the Raspberry Pi. By encrypting the data exchange between a local computer and a remote device, SSH facilitates the secure execution of commands, transfer of files, and administration of systems from a distance. This capability is particularly advantageous for managing Raspberry Pi configurations that lack direct physical access. Utilizing SSH allows for the effective control and setup of the Raspberry Pi from a separate computer via the network.<p>
<p>MobaXterm is the software that facilitates this communication, utilizing the SSH protocol.<p>



<ol type="I">
  <li> Download the software from the <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html">provided link</a> and select the portable edition.</li>
  <br>
  
  
  <li>After downloading the software, extract it to a designated folder. The program will be ready for use once launched. Ensure that both the Raspberry Pi and your device are connected to the same network to view the interface properly.</li>
  <br>

  <code>sudo reboot</code>
  <br>
  </ol>


<h3>4- Setting Up the Arduino IDE on a Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>We will download the Arduino IDE onto the Raspberry Pi to upload Arduino C code to the Arduino board via the serial connection between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. This will be done through the following steps:<p>


  <ol type="I">
  <li>Open the terminal by clicking on the terminal icon or by using the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T.</li>
  <br>
  
  <li>Enter the following command:</li>
  <code>sudo apt install arduino</code>
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <li>Before utilizing the IDE, it is necessary to configure the permissions for the Arduino port on the Raspberry Pi. Connect the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi via a USB cable. Open the terminal on the Raspberry Pi and enter the following command to display the list of available ports on your Raspberry Pi:</li>
  <code>ls /dev/tty*</code>
  <br>
  <br>
  


  <li>
The Arduino port is likely to be identified as either<code>/dev/ttyACM0</code>  or <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>. By default, serial ports on the Raspberry Pi are inaccessible to standard users. To enable access to the Arduino port, utilize the `chmod` command to modify the permissions associated with the port. Execute the command below, substituting <code>*/dev/ttyACM0</code> with the actual port identifier you noted earlier:</li>

<br>
<code>ls /dev/tty*</code>
<br>
<br>

  <li>Once you've executed the chmod command, you will have the appropriate permissions to access the Arduino port, and you can begin using the Arduino with your Raspberry Pi.</li>

<h2>Mobility Management</h2>

<h3>1-VEHICLEMAINBODY</h3>
<p>The main body of the vehicle was divided into two sections. The 3D printing section comprises four parts: the upper structure, two parts forming a camera holder, and the last part serving as a battery holder.<br> 
The second part of the structure we bought a chassis that features rear-wheel drive combined with a front steering mechanism, enabling it to turn both left and right. Also, it is made from aluminum which is a good material due to its lightness and durability. We chose this option for its high manufacturing quality, which reduces errors compared to other options.

The main microcontroller is an Atmega mounted on an Arduino Mega 2560 board. To ensure accurate and efficient control and direction of the vehicleâ€™s movement, we employed several crucial components which are :
<br> â€¢ ServoMotorModel
<br> â€¢ DCMotor500RPM
<br> â€¢ BTSMotorDriver</p>
<p>The servo motor model was selected for controlling the vehicleâ€™s steering, while the BTS7960 motor driver is utilized to control the movement of the DC motor, providing the necessary power to drive the vehicleâ€™s motion.</p>


  <h3>2-Motion Mechanism.</h3>
  <p>We implemented Ackermann steering by installing a servo motor that allows the steering mechanism to operate freely. Additionally, a DC motor with a 500 rpm output acts as the propulsion motor. The kinetic energy produced by the DC motor is conveyed to the rear wheels through a differential gearbox, and this energy is transmitted to the wheels via drive shafts constructed from LEGO components. Now we will explain both of the <b>Ackermann steering</b> and the <b>Differential gear:</b></p>
  <h4>1-Ackerman Steering Mechanism</h4>
  <p>Our design features an Ackermann steering mechanism, essential for providing efficient and responsive steering performance. The Ackermann steering principle is instrumental in minimizing tire wear and enhancing the vehicle's handling, especially during turns.</p>
   <p>The key features and benefits of the Ackermann steering is that it enhances maneuverability by reducing tire slippage during turns. This is achieved by configuring the steering linkages to allow the inner wheel to turn at a sharper angle than the outer wheel. Each wheel follows its own natural arc around the corner, leading to more precise steering and better vehicle control. Additionally, the Ackermann steering mechanism streamlines the overall design of the steering system. It eliminates the need for complex gear arrangements, which reduces weight and potential failure points within the system. This simpler design also leads to easier maintenance and lower manufacturing costs.</p>

<b>Working Mechanism of Ackermann Steering: </b>
<p>The functionality of the Ackermann steering system can be summarized as follows:</p>
<b>Steering Input Translation:</b> When the servo motor is activated, the input is conveyed through the steering linkage to both front wheels. The unique angles and lengths of the steering arms cause the inner wheel to turn more sharply than the outer wheel.<p>
<p><b>Cornering:</b> During cornering, the Ackermann geometry ensures that each wheel follows its respective path, minimizing slippage and enhancing the vehicle's grip on the playing field.</p>
<b>Key Parameters of Ackermann Steering</b>

<p><b>Steering Ratio:</b> In the Ackermann steering system, the steering ratio describes the relationship between the rotation of the servo angle and the resulting rotation of the wheels. It can be expressed mathematically as follows:</p>
<p>Steering Ratio = <span>&theta;<sub>Servo angle</sub></span> / <span>&theta;<sub>wheels</sub></span></p>

<p>A higher steering ratio means that a smaller rotation of the servo angle results in a larger rotation of the wheels, providing greater turning capability. Conversely, a lower steering ratio requires more rotation of the servo to achieve the same amount of wheel rotation, resulting in a less sensitive steering response.</p>
<b>Servo Motor Torque</b>
<p>Steering torque (T<sub>servo</sub>) is the force applied to the servo as a result of the torque output from the steering system. It is calculated by multiplying the applied force by the effective lever arm length (L<sub>eff</sub>):</p>
<p><strong>T<sub>servo</sub> = F<sub>steering</sub> Ã— L<sub>eff</sub></strong></p>
<p>Higher servo motor torque indicates that more force is needed to turn the wheels, providing greater resistance to steering and a more stable driving experience.</p>
<b>Steering Wheel Angle</b>
<p>The steering wheel angle refers to the angular displacement of the steering wheel from its neutral position. This angle determines the orientation of the vehicle's steering mechanism and, consequently, its direction of movement:</p>

<h4>2-Differential Gear</h4>

<h4>Current Implementation and Challenges</h4>

<p>The differential gear is a vital component in our robot, ensuring that the rear wheels can spin at different rates while maintaining balanced power distribution. This mechanism is particularly crucial during turns or when traction varies between the two wheels, allowing for smooth and controlled movement. Hereâ€™s an overview of the differential gear system and its components:</p>

<strong>Components:</strong>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Ring Gear:</strong> This large gear, attached to the axle shaft, receives power from the engine or driveshaft.</li>
    <li><strong>Pinion Gear:</strong> A smaller gear that connects to the drive shaft and meshes with the ring gear.</li>
    <li><strong>Side Gears:</strong> Two gears that link the differential to the axle shafts.</li>
    <li><strong>Spider Gears:</strong> Positioned between the side gears, these gears permit the wheels to rotate at varying speeds.</li>
</ol>
<img src="repository-pictures/Car mechanics/DF.jpg" alt=".....">
<figcaption>Figure 21: Lego Differential Gear</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Functionality:</strong>
<p>When the vehicle travels in a straight line, the differential distributes torque equally to both wheels. During a turn, the inside wheel (closer to the center of the turn) needs to rotate slower than the outside wheel to prevent slippage. The differential achieves this by allowing the side gears to rotate at different speeds while still distributing power effectively.</p>

<strong>Calculating Gear Ratio:</strong>
<p>Before designing a differential gear, determining the gear ratio is crucial. This involves understanding the motor specifications and the differentialâ€™s mechanical setup. The gear ratio can be calculated by counting the teeth on the ring gear and the side gears:</p>

<p>$$ \text{GR} = \frac{R}{S1 + S2} $$</p>


<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>R</code> is the number of teeth on the ring gear.</li>
    <li><code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> are the number of teeth on each side gear.</li>
</ul>

<p>This ratio indicates the rotational speed and torque distribution between the two side gears of the differential. Once calculated, this ratio helps relate the motor speed to the wheel speed. The wheel speed N<sub>wheel</sub> can be derived from the motorâ€™s no-load speed <sup>N<sub>Motor, no-load</sub> using the formula:</p>

<p> $$ N_{\text{wheel}} = \frac{N_{\text{Motor, no-load}}}{\text{GR}} $$ </p>

<p>The wheel speed reflects the rotational speed of the differentialâ€™s side gears, directly influencing the vehicleâ€™s speed. While theoretical calculations provide a baseline, real-world values often require calibration due to various unaccounted constraints.</p>

<h4>Suggestions and Future Modifications</h4>

<strong>Current Differential Issues:</strong>
<p>In our current design, we utilized a LEGO differential; however, we observed several shortcomings, specifically its low durability and the high flexibility of the LEGO axles.</p>

<strong>Recommended Differential Upgrade:</strong>
<p>To enhance the vehicleâ€™s performance, we recommend using a metal differential with metal axles, which offer greater durability and reduced flexibility. This upgrade will ensure:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Increased Durability:</strong> Metal differentials are more robust and can withstand higher stress and load without failing, ensuring longer operational life and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Flexibility:</strong> Metal axles are less flexible compared to LEGO axles, resulting in more precise and consistent power transmission to the wheels, improving overall vehicle control.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Impact on Vehicle Performance:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Stability:</strong> The reduced flexibility and increased robustness of the metal components will provide greater stability, particularly during turns and when navigating uneven terrain.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Power Transmission:</strong> The precise and consistent power transmission afforded by metal axles will enhance the vehicleâ€™s responsiveness and maneuverability.</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term Reliability:</strong> The durability of metal differentials ensures that the vehicle can operate under demanding conditions without frequent maintenance or replacement of parts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementing these modifications will significantly improve the vehicle's performance, making it more reliable and efficient in navigating the challenges of the competition.</p>

<h3> 2-Motor Driver</h3>
<p>A motor driver is an indispensable device in controlling motors because it allows the safe handling and delivery
of required power for driving the motor; at the same time, it includes protection features to guard against
damage under abnormal operating conditions. In addition, the motor driver provides accurate control, speed,
direction, and acceleration. A driver is a must for those applications that require precise positioning or motion
control, as in our case. It has bidirectional control, works with various motor types, and optimizes power usage
for more efficiency</p>

<h3>4- Lego Axles</h3>
<p>Using the LEGO axles (4.8mm Diameter) on both the differential gears mechanism and the wheels connecting leads to a significant improvement in the robot's efficiency. The axles deliver accurate rotary motion while cutting down friction and energy losses. It is made of PA (Polyamide), which is a type of material that can withhold high loads and impacts. This means it is suitable for elements that have to be tough and can interact with each other, thus enabling a smooth power transmission of prolonged operation.</p>

<h3> 2-Overall Circuit Current Usage</h3>
 <p> here are many reasons why it is important to have an accurate knowledge of the electrical component requirements which include</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Dual Mode (Operational and Sleep):</strong>
            <p>The power supply system is programmed to handle different current requirements when the robot is active (Operational) and when it is in a power-saving mode (Sleep). This helps in ensuring that the robot operates efficiently without draining unnecessary power when not performing intensive tasks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optimize for Battery Life:</strong>
            <p>Understanding the power consumption of each component is essential for optimizing battery life. By analyzing the current draw in various operational states, strategies can be developed to extend battery life, such as selecting the appropriate batteries and implementing power-saving modes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Heat Management:</strong>
            <p>The total current load on a circuit contributes to the amount of heat generated by electrical components. Knowing this helps in designing effective cooling measures, which are crucial for preventing overheating that could lead to performance degradation or hardware damage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Safety:</strong>
            <p>Accurate knowledge of the maximum current that each component draws is essential for designing a safe electrical system. This includes ensuring that all components can handle the peak currents under load without risk of electrical failures or hazards.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong>
            <p>By understanding the exact power needs of each component, more cost-effective components and systems that meet the necessary specifications without excess can be selected.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>


<h3>3-Circuit Grounding</h3>
    <p>Circuit grounding connects all components with a common ground, providing a reference point for all voltages in the circuit and dramatically simplifying the measurement of voltage at any point in the circuit. It ensures the signal moves accurately without distortion, prevents electrical shocks, and safeguards the equipment, as well as people, from hazards that can arise otherwise.</p>
    <p>Grounding reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) by allowing a path for unwanted currents to dissipate harmlessly into the ground. This can greatly improve the performance and overall reliability of the circuit. Grounding stabilizes the voltage levels, preventing voltage fluctuation by ensuring a consistent electrical potential across all components. It may also help in reducing some noise and interference within the circuit. When several sections of the circuit share a common reference point, one can better filter noise and interference.</p>

  <h3>4-Power Supply</h3>
    <p>In the revised setup, an 11.1V â€“ 2700mAh 35C Li-Poly RC battery is used as the power source, which directly provides 11.1V to both the BTS motor driver and the RioRand step-down DC-DC converter. The converter adjusts the voltage from 11.1V down to 5V to power the Arduino board. Additionally, the Arduino Sensor Shield, which conveniently offers the GND and VCC pins for connecting ultrasonic sensors, a servo motor, and a gyroscope without the need for a bridge or extra pins. This configuration results in a visually pleasing circuit that provides easy access to all pins and simplifies the troubleshooting of faults and issues. The DC motor receives power directly from the battery through the BTS motor driver, maintaining the supply at 11.1 volts.</p>

  <h3>5-Overall Scheme</h3>
    <p>Due to the large number of electronic components used in our circuit, we utilized a special power supply distribution using basic electronic components. The description below provides an overview of the electrical design:</p>

<h2>Obstacle Management</h2>

<h3>1-Open Challenge Algorithm</h3>
<p>In this section, we detail our approach for the Open Challenge, where the goal is to complete three laps while avoiding collisions with the track walls and achieving the fastest possible time. Our strategy involves designing a robust algorithm that ensures precise navigation and smooth transitions between different segments of the track. The track is divided into two primary zones: the Safe Zone and the Danger Zone, each requiring distinct handling strategies.</p>
<img src="repository-pictures/The algorithm/Zones.jpg" alt="..">
<figcaption>Figure 27: zones Division
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4> Safe Zone Navigation</h4>
<p>In the Safe Zone, the robot can move safely without the risk of colliding with the wall. The robot should maintain a straight path parallel to the wall. This is managed using a PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller that keeps the robot's angle constant. The gyroscope readings are used as inputs to the algorithm, and the setpoint is adjusted after each turn. The PD controller formula used is:</p>
<pre>PIDOutput = K_p &times; Error_t + (Error_t - Error_{t-1}) / IntervalLength &times; K_d</pre>
<p>Where:</p>

  <li><i>Error_t = GyroscopeReading - SetPoint</i></li>


<h4> Danger Zone Handling</h4>
<p>When the robot enters the Danger Zone, immediate corrective action is required to move it back to the Safe Zone. For this, we employ a P (Proportional) controller with a high proportional gain:</p>
<pre>ServoAngle = K_p &times; (D_{vertical} - D_{unprotected})</pre>
<p>Where:</p>

  <li><i>D_{vertical} = cos(Angle) &times; DS1 + DS2 / S2</i></li>


<h4> Turn Detection and Direction Control</h4>
<p>The robot detects turns at distances greater than 100 cm. If it cannot align parallel to the wall, incorrect ultrasonic readings might occur. In such cases, the robot uses its front ultrasonic sensor to detect the front wall and, if a safe turn is not possible, it moves backward until a safe turn can be made. The robot determines the movement direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) based on which side the turn is detected.</p>

<p>Overall, this algorithm ensures the robot navigates efficiently through the track, handling turns and zones with precise control to achieve the fastest lap times possible.</p>

  <h3>2-Computer Vision</h3>
    <p>Computer vision is a fundamental technology in robotics and automation, crucial for enabling self-driving cars to perceive and interpret their surroundings. In our project, computer vision (CV) techniques empower the robotic system to gather essential information, facilitating informed decision-making and immediate actions. The identification of red and green pillars is critical for collision avoidance and maintaining a clear path for the robot.</p>
    
   <p>We employ the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space for color detection due to its robustness under varying lighting conditions. Unlike other color spaces such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), HSV separates color information (hue) from luminance, enhancing its reliability.</p>
    
  <b>HSV Color Space</b>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hue:</strong> Represents the type of color, measured as an angle in degrees (0-360), where red = 0, green = 120, blue = 240.</li>
        <li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Indicates the vibrancy of the color, ranging from 0 (gray) to 100 (full color).</li>
        <li><strong>Value:</strong> Defines the brightness of the color, with 0 as black (no brightness) and 100 as fully bright.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <b>Advantages of HSV over RGB for Color Detection</b>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decomposition of Color and Luminance:</strong> HSV effectively separates hue from saturation and value, making hue less affected by lighting changes and enabling more accurate region detection. RGB combines intensity with colors, complicating the appearance of hues under varying light.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Color Filtering:</strong> HSV filters colors based on human perception, making it easier to isolate specific hues. In contrast, RGB colors can vary significantly with brightness changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting Robustness:</strong> HSV is more resilient to lighting variations, as changes in light intensity affect hue less than in RGB, allowing for consistent color matching.</li>
    </ul>

   <p>Using HSV for computer vision in our project enhances the accuracy and reliability of color detection, crucial for the robot's autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.</p>

<h3>3-Image Processing</h3>

  <h4>Setting the Camera Properties</h4>
    <p>The camera's shutter speed is adjusted according to the ambient lighting conditions. Shutter speed defines the duration for which the cameraâ€™s shutter remains open, allowing light to reach the camera sensor. In high-brightness environments, we reduce the shutter speed to limit the amount of light hitting the sensor during the calibration of HSV values. Conversely, in low-light conditions, we increase the shutter speed to allow more light to reach the sensor.</p>

  <h4>Pre-Processing</h4>
    <p>Pre-processing is essential before isolating the pillars to extract information. This step involves cleaning the captured images to remove unwanted artifacts, ensuring more accurate and reliable segmentation results. Cropping the frame removes distracting elements that might be mistaken for pillars.</p>

  <h4>Masking</h4>
    <p>To isolate specific colors, the image is first converted from the BGR color space to the HSV color space. We then identify the upper and lower HSV values of the target colors (red, green, or pink). Each pixel in the HSV frame is examined to determine if it falls within the specified color range. If it does, the corresponding pixel value in the mask will be white; otherwise, it will be black. The resulting mask frame will display white pixels for the desired color range and black pixels for all other colors.</p>

  <p>Our HSV values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Red1:</strong> Lower value: [], Upper value: []</li>
        <li><strong>Red2:</strong> Lower value: [], Upper value: []</li>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Lower value: [], Upper value: []</li>
        <li><strong>Pink:</strong> Lower value: [], Upper value: []</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: HSV values may vary under different lighting conditions.</p>

  <h4>Contouring</h4>
    <p>Contour detection is the process of identifying the boundaries or edges of objects within an image. This process is fundamental to many image analysis applications, including image segmentation, object recognition, and classification.</p>
    <br>
<img src="Flow_Charts/pictures/contuors.png" alt="...">

   <p><strong>Steps in the Contouring Process:</strong></p>

        <li>Finding the Contour Area:
            <pre>cv2.contourArea(contour)</pre>

            <pre>cv2.moments(contour)</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Calculating Distance: The distance is calculated using a formula derived by plotting a curve between the actual distance and the contour area.</li>
    </ol>

  <h4>Our Algorithm to Avoid the Pillars</h4>
    <p>At the start of each section, the Raspberry Pi captures an image using the camera. It processes the image and applies a mask to detect any pillars in front of the vehicle. If a pillar is detected and the distance is less than 50 cm, the Raspberry Pi sends a signal to the Arduino ('G' for a green pillar, 'R' for a red pillar, and 'N' for no pillar). The Arduino then decides the course of action: turn left for 'G', turn right for 'R', or move forward for 'N'.</p>

<img src="repository-pictures/The algorithm/OB.jpg" alt="...">
<br>
<figcaption>Figure 32:  the vehicle parking in the corner

</figure>
<br>
<br>

<p>When the vehicle reaches a corner, the Arduino determines the direction of movement and communicates this to the Raspberry Pi ('L' for counterclockwise and 'R' for clockwise). At the end of each section, the Arduino sends a 'Hello' message to the Raspberry Pi, prompting it to take an image, process it, and report the current status back to the Arduino. The possible status cases are GG, G, RR, R, RG, and GR.</p>



<h3>4-Problems We Encountered</h3>

  <h4>Wave Interference</h4>
    <p>When two sensors on the same side of the robot operate simultaneously, the sound waves they emit can interfere with each other. To address this issue, we implemented a method where only sensors on opposite sides operate at any given time while the other sensors are disabled. Specifically, we take readings sequentially from R1 and L2, then R2 and L1, followed by F and B. This approach prevents wave interference during distance measurements.</p>

  <h4>Small Turn Angle and Sliding</h4>
    <p>Initially, the robot experienced issues with a small turn angle and sliding, primarily due to the absence of a differential gear. This caused the robot to require a large distance to achieve the desired turn angle, and the front tires often slipped. We resolved these problems by integrating a differential gear, which enhanced the turning capability and stability of the robot.</p>

  <h4>Flickering</h4>
    <p>Flickering refers to the visible fluctuation in brightness or color in video frames, which can occur rapidly and intermittently. We encountered this issue with the Raspberry Pi 4 and Camera Module 3 setup. Flickering can make the video output appear unstable and less effective for its intended use. We resolved this by adjusting the camera's shutter speed:</p>

   <pre>picam2.set_controls({"ExposureTime": shutter_speed})</pre>

  <p>This adjustment stabilized the video output, ensuring reliable performance for image processing tasks.</p>

  <h3>1-Open Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes, the use of a gyroscope sensor can result in incorrect setpoint calculation. There is evidence for this in that after the robot has turned, it may not be turned precisely 90 degrees, maybe less or more. So, a correction formula is applied that corrects the reading from the gyro and calculates the correct set point.

  <h3>2-Obstacle Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    There are a few issues with the current vehicle, which utilizes Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3. For this, we suggest upgrading to the Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435 since it will resolve all of these issues and improve reliability in general. The camera is used to provide accurate depth perception so it can measure how far away Pillars and other solid obstacles are. In addition, a wider field of view helps detect obstacles. Its integrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) provides motion tracking better depth accuracy and more stable than ever. This is especially useful in dynamic environments where the vehicle needs to quickly respond.

  <h3>3-Differential</h3>
  <p>
    In our current design, we utilized a LEGO differential; however, we observed some shortcomings, specifically its low durability and the high flexibility of the LEGO axles. To enhance the vehicleâ€™s performance, we recommend using a metal differential with metal axles, which offers greater durability and reduced flexibility.

  <h3>4-Micro-controller Upgrade</h3>
  <p>
    In our vehicle, we utilized an Arduino Mega 2560 to control the motors and process sensor outputs, and a Raspberry Pi 4 with a camera to capture images, detect pillars, and send signals to the Arduino for appropriate actions. However, we observed some limitations, particularly in the computational power and integration complexity of using two separate devices. To enhance the systemâ€™s performance and streamline the architecture, we recommend using an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The Jetson Nano provides significantly more computational power, allowing for advanced algorithms, real-time data processing, and machine learning applications. Designed specifically for AI applications, it can handle deep learning and image processing tasks, which are essential for complex navigation and obstacle avoidance. This upgrade would consolidate the tasks currently managed by both the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Arduino into a single, more powerful unit.

<h3>5- Sensor Upgrades</h3>

  <b>Distance Measurement</b>
  <p>
    The current setup using Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) presents several limitations. To address these issues and improve system reliability, we recommend upgrading to Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensors (VL53L1X) or LiDAR (RPLIDAR A1). This upgrade will resolve the existing problems (e.g., delay in responding) and enhance overall performance. ToF sensors and LiDAR deliver more accurate distance measurements, which are crucial for detecting how far away the surrounding objects are. Furthermore, they offer a faster response time, essential for real-time wall and obstacles detection. Both sensors also provide better range and resolution, significantly boosting navigation capabilities.

  <p>
    We identified some shortcomings in accuracy and stability with the MPU-6050 used in our current vehicle. To address these issues and improve the systemâ€™s performance, we suggest upgrading to the Bosch BNO055. The BNO055 features an advanced 9-axis sensor with integrated sensor fusion algorithms, offering enhanced accuracy in orientation and motion tracking. Additionally, it provides better stability by effectively managing drift and noise, ensuring consistent performance in dynamic environments.

  <h3>6-Power Management System (PMS)</h3>
  <p>
    Our current design employs basic power distribution using a Li-Poly battery and DC-DC converters; however, there are opportunities to improve battery management and power stability. To address these issues, we suggest upgrading to a Battery Management System (BMS). A BMS monitors individual cell voltages, temperatures, and overall battery health, which helps extend battery life and ensures safe operation. Additionally, it provides efficient power distribution to all components, maintaining stable voltage levels and preventing power fluctuations.
